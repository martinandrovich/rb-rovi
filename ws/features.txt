// compute the lines of the two points 
m1 = M.at<cv::Point2d>(0,0)
m2 = M.at<cv::Point2d>(vec1)
m3 = M.at<cv::Point2d>(vec2)

// and, generate the lines
l1 = m2 - m1
l2 = m2 - m1

// Angle between them should approximately be 90 degrees, ie dot product should be 0

( l1 dot l2 ) / ( |l1| * |l2| ) = one guess

// the one closest to 90 degree is probably the best origin, try all permutations if not close, reiterae if not close to 90.
